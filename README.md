## Purpose
The purpose of designing this software, aimed at NEU students for the gratuitous lending and borrowing of items, is to establish an intra-campus mutual assistance and sharing platform. We hope that through this software, students can conveniently borrow or lend out items they temporarily don't need, but which might be urgently required by their peers, such as textbooks, study tools, and daily necessities. This initiative not only conserves resources and reduces waste but also strengthens the spirit of mutual assistance among students, fostering a more harmonious and convenient living environment for the entire school community.

## Definitions
Our team has meticulously crafted ‘ShareCycle’ for NEU students - an innovative digital sharing platform. Our goal is to promote a culture of mutual assistance and resource sharing within the campus. With this application, students can conveniently lend or borrow items they aren't currently using, ranging from textbooks to everyday essentials. Through ‘ShareCycle’, we aspire not only to enhance the efficiency of resource utilization but also to further strengthen the ties and collaboration within the NEU student community, collectively forging a more harmonious and efficient campus living environment.

## Background
In contemporary society, the sharing economy is a concept that resonates with many. The rise of the sharing economy, exemplified by the global success of platforms like Airbnb and Uber, highlights the manifold benefits of resource sharing. Moreover, in our preliminary user survey, we interviewed several NEU students. Their feedback illustrated a scenario where the university boasts abundant resources, yet they are not evenly distributed. For instance, many students purchase textbooks or study materials for short-term use, and some struggle to access specific resources during pivotal moments, such as right before examinations or project deadlines.
Inspired by these insights and survey findings, our team discerned the necessity for a platform tailored specifically for the Northeastern University student community. On this platform, students can share or borrow resources, promoting a sense of community and collaboration while optimizing resource utilization and minimizing waste. Consequently, the concept of 'ShareCycle' was conceived: a platform designed to maximize resource efficiency, enhance student connectivity, and foster a more harmonious and sustainable campus environment.
