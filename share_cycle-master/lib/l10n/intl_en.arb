  "about_content": "This software is designed to provide a platform for students at Northeastern University to borrow and lend items for free, aiming to build a community of mutual support and sharing on campus. We hope that through this software, students can easily borrow or lend items they do not need at the moment but may be urgently needed by their classmates, such as textbooks, study tools and daily necessities. It is hoped that this software will not only help conserve resources and minimize waste, but also strengthen the spirit of mutual assistance among students, thereby promoting a more harmonious and convenient living environment for the entire school community."
